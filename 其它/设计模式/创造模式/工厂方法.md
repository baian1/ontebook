# Factory Method

一个 creator,里面有各种各样的方法  
通过子 creator 实现 creater 的 factoryMethod

```ts
abstract class Creator {
  /**
   * Note that the Creator may also provide some default implementation of the
   * factory method.
   */
  public abstract factoryMethod(): Product;

  /**
   * Also note that, despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility is
   * not creating products. Usually, it contains some core business logic that
   * relies on Product objects, returned by the factory method. Subclasses can
   * indirectly change that business logic by overriding the factory method
   * and returning a different type of product from it.
   */
  public someOperation(): string {
    // Call the factory method to create a Product object.
    const product = this.factoryMethod();
    // Now, use the product.
    return `Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with ${product.operation()}`;
  }
}
```

这些方法是通过调用 Product 的方法实现的  
我们通过继承 creator 实现了 不同的 factoryMethod  
然后我们知道 creator,可以简单的调用不同 product 的相同方法

## 例子

比如一个交通工具 Factor,运输东西 deliver

```ts
interface Transportation {
  deliver: () => {};
}
abstract class Creator {
  /**
   * Note that the Creator may also provide some default implementation of the
   * factory method.
   */
  public abstract getTransportation(): Transportation;

  /**
   * Also note that, despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility is
   * not creating products. Usually, it contains some core business logic that
   * relies on Product objects, returned by the factory method. Subclasses can
   * indirectly change that business logic by overriding the factory method
   * and returning a different type of product from it.
   */
  public deliver(): string {
    // Call the factory method to create a Product object.
    const product = this.factoryMethod();
    // Now, use the product.
    return product.deliver();
  }
}
```

具体实现,飞机 飞行,轮船 航行,车 陆行

```ts
class createPlan extends Creator {
  getTransportation(){
    return new
  }
}

class Plan implements Transportation {
  deliver(){
    return "飞"
  }
}
```

调用

```ts
function yunshu(Transportation: Creator) {
  Transportation.deliver();
}
yunshu(new createPlan());
```

## 通俗解释

一个工厂,生产降温用工具  
多种产品 空调,风扇,清凉油等  
顾客购买产品后,使用降温功能

工厂方法,将产品抽象出来,有一个降温功能,客户拿到产品可以直接使用**降温功能**,而不是使用**打开空调**,**摇摆风扇**,**涂抹清凉油**
